# Maximum resistive motor ball throwing distance and path by deep reinforcement learning
•	Calculated single or double resistive motor maximum ball throwing distance and path by different reinforcement learning algorithm like td0, policy gradient, a3c, dql by python.
•	Designed user interface to control the motors to perform ball throwing and made RL model imitate and learned from these data 
•	Used svgwrite to demo (visualize) project including user input ball throwing method and model’s training process.
•	Analyzed the result and advantages of different reinforcement learning algorithm, and try to interpret why some of them are more suitable for this problem since no one did similar research to this one.

If you want to demo by yourself, install virtual environment and svgwrite then run in the terminal.
